## Angular Recipes

1)

Replace X in apiKey and apiDomain in ```app.component.ts``` ```ngOnInit``` lifecycle hook. Firebase was used in dev, so it is suggested you do the same and enable authentication on your backend to receive the config.

2) 

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

3)

```bash
ng serve
```

4)
```bash
https://localhost/4200
```
